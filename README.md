# EWU CSCD 305
## C++ Programming
This repo will serve as the collection of my work during my enrollment in EWU CSCD 305 - C++ Programming.

## CMake Project
I will be utilizing CMake for all my work in this class since I'm working in Linux and Windows (at times). If you're familiar with CMake, building and running any of these should be a breeze.

Feel free to comment out any of the `add_subdirectory` calls to avoid building assignments you don't care about.

Alternatively, you can just rip my source files and use them however you like anywhere.

## Missing Source Files
You may notice at times I am missing some source code from the project, but link to to the compiled `.o` file instead. This is because I will not be including any instruction material or source material that was not written by myself, as to not give away anyone else's code or the course material for free. If you're interested in the course material, see [here](https://www.ewu.edu/apply/).
